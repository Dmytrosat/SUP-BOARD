# 👋 Hi!
# I'm Dmytro Satanovsky, from Ukraine, Lviv.
# This is my final project for the CS50 course.
  - I created a one-page of site called SUP-BOARD.
  - This site promotes a healthy lifestyle, including waterboarding on sup board.
  - I used the following tools to create the site: HTML, CSS, JS.
  - The layout of the site page is valid.
  - The layout of the site page is semantic.
  - Layout of the site page - corresponds to the layout.
  - To build a grid, flexes or a grid are used.
  - After zooming out of the browser page, the layout is placed in the center.
  - After hovering and clicking, there is a smooth change in the appearance of page elements.
  - PerfectPixel extension is used to check the conformity of the layout to the layout.
